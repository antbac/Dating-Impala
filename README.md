The current version does not use any database.

If you still wish to run the service as is, then here is how you go about doing it:
First of all, make sure you have nodejs installed as it makes up the core of the server. After that
running npm install in the main folder should be all that is needed for the install.
You might have to setup the accecs on the .npm folder depending on what distro you run.

To start the application just run "npm start" and then go to http://localhost:8080
